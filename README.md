# Circle of Influence Workshop - Input Collection

Welcome to the **Dealing with Change: Circle of Influence** workshop!

This repository is where you'll submit the concerns and challenges you're currently facing. Your input will help us work together during the workshop to categorize what you can control, what you can influence, and what lies outside your sphere of influence.
